# ScalaScraperJLSTest
#### This project utilizes [Scala Scraper](https://github.com/ruippeixotog/scala-scraper) to extract references from all sections of the [Java Language Specification (JLS) - SE 22 Edition](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/index.html) and constructs a directed graph based on reference counts. It then performs topological sorting to visualize the dependency hierarchy of JLS sections.

#### Output of topological ordering:
